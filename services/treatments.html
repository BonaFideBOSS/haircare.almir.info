      <h1>Hair Loss and Treatments</h1>
      <p>There are many reasons why your hair might be falling out. Whether this is temporary, reversible, or permanent
        there are options you can consider that may help.</p>
      <p>The most important step is to visit a doctor so that they can diagnose the cause of your hair loss.</p>

      <div class="row my-5">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <h2 id="whyhairloss">Why Is My Hair Falling Out?</h2>
          <p>Finding hair in your brush is normal: We shed. But if a person starts losing an unusual amount of hair, it
            can be cause for concern.</p>
          <p>Losing hair normally doesn’t have much effect on your appearance or warmth, as your head has plenty more to
            make up for the daily loss. But there may be a more significant reason for your hair loss when you start
            seeing your scalp or bald spots.</p>
          <p>When you think of hair loss, you may think of the genetic factors, such as female pattern baldness.
            Hormones, thyroid problems, and other diseases can all cause hair loss too.</p>
          <p>So, what are these various causes, and how do you know if they’re to blame for your excessive shedding?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 align-self-center">
          <img src="treatments/hairloss-1.jpg" width="100%">
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row g-5 my-5">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h3>Hormonal changes</h3>
          <p>Women may lose hair following childbirth or while in menopause. Women who have hormonal imbalances can have
            hair loss.</p>
          <p>Aside from genetic female pattern baldness, women can lose hair as their hormonal composition changes with
            age.
            Hair loss is caused by your follicles’ response to the hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h3>Thyroid disorders</h3>
          <p>Perhaps one of the most common hormone-related causes for hair loss is a thyroid problem. Both too much
            thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) and too little (hypothyroidism) can lead to hair loss. Treating the
            thyroid
            disorder can often reverse the hair loss.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h3>Stress</h3>
          <p>Physical and psychological stress can cause hair loss. Surgery, high fevers, and blood loss can cause
            enough stress to result in excessive shedding. Childbirth can result in hair loss for several months after
            delivery.</p>
          <p>As for psychological stress, the link is less well-defined. However, many people have reported losing hair
            at times of extreme mental stress or anxiety. And hair loss for other reasons can still be stressful.</p>
          <p>The causes of physical stress are often temporary, and the hair loss subsides as the body heals.</p>
          <p>You can combat mental stress with lifestyle changes, such as:
            <ul>
              <li>daily exercise</li>
              <li>proper nutrition</li>
              <li>meditation and other stress management strategies</li>
              <li>removing known stressors from your life</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h3>Medications</h3>
          <p>Pharmaceuticals can come with a long list of side effects, including hair loss. Chemotherapy is the most
            well-known cause, but others include:
            <ul>
              <li>thyroid medications</li>
              <li>some oral contraceptives</li>
              <li>beta-blockers</li>
              <li>anticonvulsants</li>
              <li>antidepressants</li>
              <li>anticoagulants</li>
              <p>These medications affect people differently and may not cause hair loss in everyone.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h3 id="NutrientDeficiencies">Nutritional deficiencies</h3>
          <p>Zinc and iron deficiency are the most common nutritional links to hair loss. But some evidence indicates
            that low intakes of the following vitamins and nutrients could also be to blame:
            <ul>
              <li>fats</li>
              <li>vitamin D</li>
              <li>vitamin B-12</li>
              <li>vitamin C</li>

        <div>
          <h3>Other medical conditions</h3>
          <p>Many other medical conditions can lead to abnormal balding, including:
            <ul>
              <li>renal failure</li>
              <li>inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)</li>
              <li>liver disease</li>
              <li>diabetes</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Skin conditions such as psoriasis and dermatitis can occur on the scalp and interfere with hair growth.
            Infections such as ringworm of the scalp and folliculitis can also cause hair loss.</p>
          <p>The search for causes and potential treatments by people experiencing hair loss is understandable. Research
            has tied hair loss to lower self-esteem, body image issues, and increased anxiety.</p>
          <p>Many of these nongenetic causes for hair loss can be successfully treated, and the hair loss averted and
            even
            reversed.</p>
          <h5>We’ll go over common, conventional, and complementary treatments available to treat hair loss.</h5>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h2>What can you do about hair loss?</h2>
          <p>As we have seen above, hair loss caused by hormonal changes, like pregnancy or menopause, or stress may
            not require any treatment. Instead, the loss will likely stop on its own after the body adjusts.</p>
          <p><a href="#NutrientDeficiencies">Nutrient deficiencies</a> can usually be addressed through changes in
            diet, the use of supplements, and the guidance of a doctor or registered dietitian. The guidance of a
            doctor is necessary if the deficiency is caused by an underlying medical condition.</p>
          <p>Any medical conditions that lead to hair loss should be treated directly to address the full condition,
            not just its symptoms.</p>
          <p>That said, there are a number of possible medications and treatments for hair loss caused by female
            pattern baldness and other alopecia’s. You may need to use one or a combination of treatments for months
            or years to see the full results.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h3>Minoxidil topical solution</h3>
          <p>Also known as Rogaine, this over-the-counter (OTC) medication can be used with alopecia areata or
            androgenic alopecia.</p>
          <p>This drug comes in foam or liquid form and is spread on the scalp each day. It may cause more hair loss
            at first, and new growth may be shorter and thinner than before. You may also need to use it six months or
            more to prevent further loss and promote regrowth.</p>
          <p>Side effects include:
            <ul>
              <li>scalp irritation</li>
              <li>hair growth on other parts of the face or hands that come in contact with the medication</li>
              <li>tachycardia (rapid heart rate)</li>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h3>Prescription spironolactone pills</h3>
          <p>Otherwise known as Aldactone, the drug spironolactone works to treat hair loss by addressing hormones.
            Specifically, it binds to androgen receptors and decreases the body’s processing of testosterone.</p>
          <img src="treatments/hairloss-spironolactone.jpg" width="100%">
          <p>Not all researchers agree that it works effectively, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
            not labeled it as a treatment for androgenic alopecia.</p>
          <p>Talk to a doctor or pharmacist about possible benefits and risks of spironolactone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <h3>Corticosteroid injections</h3>
          <p>Women with hair loss due to alopecia areata may consider treatment with corticosteroids injected at
            multiple sites in the affected area.</p>
          <p>Hair growth may be noticeable in as soon as four weeks, and treatment can be repeated every four to six
            weeks. Side effects with injections include:
            <ul>
              <li>skin atrophy</li>
              <li>a thinning of the scalp skin</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Topical corticosteroids are also available, but they aren’t necessarily as effective, and oral
            corticosteroids may lead to unpleasant side effects.</p>

          <h3>Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy</h3>
          <p>Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy includes three steps:
            <ol>
              <li>Drawing a person’s blood.</li>
              <li>Processing it.</li>
              <li>Injecting it back into the scalp.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>This treatment is relatively new and, as a result, there isn’t much research to support its
            effectiveness. That said, some studies have shown it to be a simple, cost effective
            treatment option.</p>
          <p>PRP therapy involves several sessions within a four to six week period with maintenance every four to six
            months.</p>
          <p>Possible risks include:
            <ul>
              <li>injury to blood vessels or nerves</li>
              <li>infection</li>

          <h3>Light and laser therapy</h3>
          <p>Laser devices may stimulate hair growth for people with androgenic alopecia and pattern balding. Other
            names of laser treatment include:
            <ul>
              <li>red light therapy</li>
              <li>cold laser</li>
              <li>soft laser</li>
              <li>photobiomodulation</li>
              <li>biostimulation</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Devices are available without a prescription in the form of brushes, combs, and other handheld items.
            They emit light and may also make existing hair thicker.</p>
          <p>You can apply laser light treatment two to three times a week. It may take several weeks to a few months
            before seeing results.</p>
          <p>It’s important to note that laser treatment is not as regulated as medications are with the FDA.
            Long-term safety and other considerations are unknown. Currently, there are no adverse effects associated
            with laser therapy.</p>

          <h3>Topical tretinoin</h3>
          <p>Retin-A, or topical tretinoin, is sometimes used as a combination therapy with minoxidil for androgenic
            alopecia.</p>
          <p>It’s important to use this type of medication under the guidance of your doctor. In some circumstances,
            tretinoin can actually cause hair loss.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h3>Topical anthralin</h3>
          <p>In women with alopecia areata, anthralin is both safe and effective. It can be applied at home, once a
            day, starting with just 5 minutes and working up to periods as long as an hour.</p>
          <p>After application, the scalp should be rinsed with cool water and cleaned with soap. New hair growth may
            sprout up in two to three months.</p>

              <p>Your diet can have an effect on hair loss. Eating a diet rich in antioxidants can help fight the signs

                oxidative stress — environmental factors that damage hair follicles. Strawberries, blueberries, beans
                and
                legumes, spinach, and kale are all sources of antioxidants.</p>
              <p>Sugar, processed fats, preservatives, and alcohol can all contribute to oxidative stress. Keep this in

      <h1>Hair Graying: What, Why & How To Reverse Premature Graying?</h1>
      <img src="treatments/hairgraying-1.jpg" width="100%" class="py-3">
      <p>Premature white hair giving you nightmares? If you’re one of those youngsters who is dealing with unwanted gray
        hair and trying to reverse it through various tricks, this article is a must-read for you.</p>

      <p>Graying hair is a part of your natural ageing process. Your skin has millions of hair follicles that contain a
        pigment called melanin. As you age, hair follicles lose this pigment turning your hair into gray. Scroll down to
        find out what causes premature graying and how you can deal with it.</p>

      <div class="row my-5 g-4">
        <h2 id="grayhaircauses">What Causes White Hair?</h2>
        <div class="col-lg-8 align-self-center">
          <h4>Genetics</h4>
          <p>According to studies, premature graying is related to genetics. It is likely that you will have
            gray hair at an early age if your mother or father had premature gray hair. It is also related to
            geography and race according to a study performed in 2013. People in a certain country can have gray
            hair much earlier than people in other countries. White people can get white hair even in their 20s,
            while Asian people most likely start getting white hair in their mid 20s. For African-Americans, the age
            of graying hair starts at 30.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-8 align-self-center">
          <h4>Stress</h4>
          <p>Stress can lead to a flood of problems like anxiety, high blood pressure, sleeping issues, skin disorders
            and so on. Adding to this list is premature graying of hair. Yes, stress can turn your hair gray. A study
            done in 2013 observed a link between stress and depletion of stem cells in the hair follicles of mice.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-8 align-self-center">
          <h4>Diet</h4>
          <p>An imbalanced diet can speed up graying of hair. Processed foods, cold drinks, excess intake of salt and
            sugar increase the risk of free radical generation in the body that can cause gray hair.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-8 align-self-center">
          <h4>Vitamin Deficiency</h4>
          <p>Yes, lack of vitamins like vitamin B, D, E, biotin can lead to premature graying of hair. Vitamin
            deficiencies can affect pigmentation, but can be reversed using vitamin supplements. Talk to your doctor if
            you want to incorporate supplements in your diet.</p>

          <h4>Pollution/Weather Conditions</h4>
          <p>Pollutants in the air generate free radicals and oxidative stress. This can in turn cause damage to the
            melanin cells, speeding up hair graying.</p>

          <h4>Oxidative Stress</h4>
          <p>Oxidative stress can be a reason behind your premature white hair. It happens when there is an imbalance
            between free radicals and antioxidants. When your antioxidants are not adequate to retaliate the effects of
            free radicals, it leads to many health issues, including ageing. Excessive oxidate causes a condition called
            vitiligo. It kills your melanin cells, leading to premature gray hair.</p>

          <h4>Chemical Hair Products</h4>
          <p>Hair care products like shampoos and conditioners can lead to premature graying of hair, due to the
            presence of chemicals which decrease your melanin content. Hair dyes containing hydrogen peroxide and
            bleaching agents can leave the hair white when used for prolonged periods.</p>

          <h4>Smoking</h4>
          <p>Smoking not only increases the risk of lung cancer and heart disease, but also puts your hair at risk.
            Smoking constricts blood vessels, reduces blood flow to hair follicles and leads to hair loss. The toxins in
            cigarette smoke can affect hair follicles causing gray hair earlier than expected.</p>

          <h4>Medical Conditions</h4>
          <p>When you talk about the causes of premature white hair, you have to consider few medical conditions as
            contributing factors. Autoimmune disease and thyroid disorder can trigger gray hair. In autoimmune disease,
            your own immune system destroys your cells instead of protecting, which can affect your hair pigmentation
            too.</p>
          <p>Your thyroid gland also influences your hair colour. In the case of a thyroid disorder, it causes hormonal
            imbalance and reduces melanin production in your body. Naturally, your hair turns gray</p>
